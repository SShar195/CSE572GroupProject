Focus on decsision trees
	Try different attributes to split on
		Kinda hard to do, features are vague at best
		We can split on activity, use that to gain a better perspective on the results 
		We can split on mean 
    We also need to focus on how we can use trees to determine feature relation
        I frankly have no idea how to do this rn, maybe more research is required or some shit idk 



We need to find a better way to relate results to eachother
	Maybe we need to look at mean in relation to another one of the scores 
		Just write something rq about the mean in relation to other things
		I'm thinking we run some regression tests? dont know how they would work with this data set but we need to run more models 
	
WE NEED TO EMPHASISZE IN THE PRESENTATION THAT WE ARE IMPROVING
FIND NEW MODELS TO TEST
    USE A DIFFRENT FEATURE FOR RANDOM FOREST

IMPROVE METHODS 
    WILL ASK FOR ARTIFIAL INTELLEGENCE HELP 

FUTURE PLAN 
    fuck if i know 
        what if theres something about implementing a stronger feature correlation pipeline 
        thats it idk
